print("The Collatz Conjecture : \n\nThe Collatz Conjecture is the simplest math problem no one can solve...\n\nThe process : \n\nIn this process you have to choose a positive number first.If your number is odd, then\nthe number will be multiplied with 3 and then 1 will be added to your number......\n\nFor example:- if you choose 7 then it will be (7 x 3) + 1 = 22.\n\nIn other hand if the number is even, then it will be divided by 2. \n\nFor example:- if you choose 30 it will be then (30 รท 2) = 15.\n\nNow the whole process runs like a loop.\n\nFor example:- if you choose the number '3'...being odd it will rise to (3 x 3) + 1 = 10 at first.\nthen 10 being even it will fall down to (10 รท 2) = 5, then the process will go on untill the number falls down to 1.\n\nThe 4 2 1 loop : \n\nThe rise and fall will stop form here as it becomes a loop now. See now the number is 1 so\n as it is odd it will rise to 4 by the rule...then 4 will be fall down to 2 and 2 will be down to 1.\n\nIt will happen again and again.No one has been able to establish a formula to solve this problem\nand that's why it is called 'The simplest unsolved math'\n\nSo I have programmed something where you can find how many steps will it take to reach the '4 2 1 loop',\nhow many steps were needed for reaching the max height and here you can find the rise and the fall of the number as height.\n\nEnjoy... =)\n\n")
